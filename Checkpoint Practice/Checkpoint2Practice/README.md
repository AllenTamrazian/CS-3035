<p>Write a Python Monster class.&nbsp; Monster should have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an&nbsp; __init__ method that takes the name and the size of the monster and creates and sets instance variables with these values</li>
<li>an attack method that takes the name of the location the monster attacks and prints out a message like</li>
</ul>
<p>Godzilla attacks Tokyo</p>
<ul>
<li>getters for the name and size of the monster</li>
<li>a reasonable __str__ method</li>
<li>an __eq__ method that overloads the == operator so that two monsters are equal if and only if they have the same name and the same size</li>
<li>an __add__ method that returns a new Monster whose name is the names of the two original monsters concatenated (for example, GodzillaKong) and size is the combined size of the two original monsters</li>
</ul>
