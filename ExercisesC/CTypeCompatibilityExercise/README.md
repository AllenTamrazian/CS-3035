<h1 class="page-title">UNGRADED Exercise: C Type Compatibility</h1>
<p><em>Design a set of simple test programs to determine the type compatibility rules of a C compiler to which you have access. Write a report of your findings.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specifically, test whether you can do various arithmetic operations on an int and a double.&nbsp; Do you get syntax or runtime errors?&nbsp; What are the data types of the results?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the same for a float and a double, an int and an array of ints, an array of ints and an array of chars, etc.&nbsp; Then check to see whether you can assign a double value to an int variable, and the other way around, and, if so, what the results are.&nbsp; Try this with other combinations of types too.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, the results of these tests will be different for gcc than for some other C compiler.</p>
