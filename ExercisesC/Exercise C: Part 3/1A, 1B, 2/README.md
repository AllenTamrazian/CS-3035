<h1 class="page-title">Ungraded Exercises: C, Part III</h1>
<p>1a) write a program in C that uses scanf to take input for two doubles and uses printf to print the result.&nbsp; Here is output from my solution:<br>3.141590 + 7.432100 = 10.573690</p>
<p>Note: use the format code lf for doubles</p>
<p>1b) modify the program from 1a so that it prints the result of the addition to 3 digits past the decimal point.&nbsp; Use the code %.3lf</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Do 1a and 1b again, but use a separate function to do the addition.&nbsp; The function should take pointers to the two doubles, but return a double rather than a pointer.&nbsp; Then try it with the function returning a pointer.&nbsp; If you try this a few times, it is likely to crash, at least sometimes, with a segmentation fault error.&nbsp; See if you can understand what is going on.</p>
