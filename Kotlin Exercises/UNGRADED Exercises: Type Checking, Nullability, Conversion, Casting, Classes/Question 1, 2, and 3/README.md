<p>Do these exercises in Kotlin.</p>
<p>1) Write code that declares two nullable String values, sets one to "Godzilla" and the other to null.&nbsp; Then, for each one, if it is not null, print the upper case version (use the String method .upper()), but if it is null, print the String "nothing to print!" Do this three different ways, once using if/else, once using the safe call operator, and once using the Elvis operator</p>
<p>2) Write a function called isLong() that takes one argument whose type is Any and returns whether or not the value is a Long.&nbsp; Test it with several values, including one that you declare as an Int but then cast to Long.</p>
<p>3) Use "as" once in a way that will correctly cast from Any to a specific type, and once in a way that will throw an exception</p>
