# CS3035 - Programming Paradigms

<h1>Course Description</h1>
<h2>University Catalog Description:</h2>
<p>Description of programming language principles; principles concerning variables, data types, subprograms, compilation/interpretation of languages. Introduction to functional programming as a programming paradigm in one or more languages. Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours.
Graded ABC/NC.</p>
<h2>Informal Description:</h2>
<p>CS 3035 consists of a ten-week unit that covers material concerning programming paradigms and the features of several important programming languages and a five-week unit in which we will study functional programming in more depth using Kotlin.</p>
<h1>Course Objectives/Outcomes</h1>
<p>The Student Learning Outcomes that are addressed by the course are: <br>-SLO #1. Students will be able to apply concepts and techniques from computing and
mathematics to both theoretical and practical problems.
<br>-SLO #2. Students will be able to demonstrate fluency in at least one programming language and acquaintance with at least three more.
<br>-SLO #3. Students will have a strong foundation in the design, analysis, and application of
many types of algorithms.
<br>-SLO #5. Students will have the training to analyze problems and identify and define the
computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.
<br>-SLO #6. Students will have the training to design, implement, and evaluate large software systems working both individually and collaboratively.
  
<br>Other outcomes of instruction: 
<br>-At the end of the course, students will be able to
<br>-Describe the concepts and design issues involving language compilation and interpretation.
<br>-Describe the concepts and design issues involving variables, the different attributes of variables.
<br>-Describe the concepts and design issues involving data types for different languages.
<br>-Describe the process of defining and running subprograms.
<br>-Describe concepts and design issues involving the formal and actual parameters of
subprograms.
<br>-Describe basic operation of a call stack.
<br>-Describe the distinguishing features of functional programming languages.
<br>-Be able to create programs using one or more functional programming languages.
<br>-Be able to use functions as parameters and return types, to use higher-order functions such as map, fold, etc., lambda functions.
<br>-Understand immutability in functional languages.
<br>-Understand partial functions and currying.
<br>-Understand how side-effects are created and the dangers they present.</p>
