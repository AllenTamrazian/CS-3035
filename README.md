# CS-3035 - Programming Paradigms

<h1>Course Description</h1>
<h2>University Catalog Description:</h2>
<p>Description of programming language principles; principles concerning variables, data types, subprograms, compilation/interpretation of languages. Introduction to functional programming as a programming paradigm in one or more languages. Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours.
Graded ABC/NC.</p>
<h2>Informal Description:</h2>
<p>CS 3035 consists of a ten-week unit that covers material concerning programming paradigms and the features of several important programming languages and a five-week unit in which we will study functional programming in more depth using Kotlin.</p>
<h1>Course Objectives/Outcomes</h1>
<p>The Student Learning Outcomes that are addressed by the course are:
\n-SLO #1. Students will be able to apply concepts and techniques from computing and
mathematics to both theoretical and practical problems.
-SLO #2. Students will be able to demonstrate fluency in at least one programming language and acquaintance with at least three more.
-SLO #3. Students will have a strong foundation in the design, analysis, and application of
many types of algorithms.
-SLO #5. Students will have the training to analyze problems and identify and define the
computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.
